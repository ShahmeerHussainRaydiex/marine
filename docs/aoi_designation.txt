Here you will find text descriptions of the possible options to use for the possible locations of technology. 
This file will primarily describe the Belgian options, as that is where the majority of the possible combinations arise.
As more data for the other countries arrives, update accordingly.
A more comprehensive document will be created that has maps of the zones assosciated with each option

'PE zone 2'
Only zone 2 from the Princess Elizabeth Zone

'PE zone 3'
Only zone 3 from the Princess Elizabeth Zone

Note that this pretends the current wind farms do not exist

'msp'
This looks at all zones that are not blocked by the MSP.
areas for military, nature reserves, shipping routes, sand extraction zones, and legacy wind farms are not available
